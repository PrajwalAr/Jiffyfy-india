# This is my first ever NextJs app. This is more like a documentation for me to keep comming back and refering to something that i might require in the future projects

Caution: The code might not be well structured as it should be, the idea is to learn from my mistakes.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
